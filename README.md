# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect spam emails. Spam emails, also known as junk mail, are unsolicited messages sent to a large number of recipients, often containing scams, phishing attempts, or other malicious content. The objective of this project is to develop a spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam based on their content and characteristics. By leveraging a dataset of labeled emails, we aim to build a predictive model that can help users filter out unwanted spam emails from their inbox.

# Evaluation
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.

# Future Work
Identify potential areas for further research and improvement, such as exploring advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, incorporating domain-specific features, and adapting the model to detect evolving spam tactics.
